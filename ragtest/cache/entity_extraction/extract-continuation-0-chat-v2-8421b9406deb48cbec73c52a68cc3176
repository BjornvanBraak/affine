He should!'\n\n'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew.\n\n'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly, 'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.'\n\n'Keep it!' repeated Scrooge's nephew. 'But you don't keep it.'\n\n'Let me leave it alone, then,' said Scrooge. 'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!'\n\n'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n'Let me hear another sound from _you_,' said Scrooge, 'and you'll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You're quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,' he added, turning to his nephew. 'I wonder you don't go\ninto Parliament.'\n\n'Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n'But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew. 'Why?'\n\n'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge.\n\n'Because I fell in love.'\n\n'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good\nafternoon!'\n\n'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?'\n\n'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.\n\n'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?'\n\n'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.\n\n'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!'\n\n'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge.\n\n'And A Happy New Year!'\n\n'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n'There's another fellow,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam.'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?'\n\n'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. 'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.'\n\n'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'\n\n'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in\noperation?'\n\n'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were\nnot.'\n\n'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>Scrooge is a character who is miserly and dismissive of Christmas, showing a lack of compassion for others.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE'S NEPHEW<|>PERSON<|>Scrooge's nephew is a kind-hearted individual who values Christmas and tries to invite his uncle to celebrate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLERK<|>PERSON<|>The clerk works for Scrooge and is more warm-hearted than his employer, showing appreciation for Christmas.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARLEY<|>PERSON<|>Marley is Scrooge's deceased business partner who has been dead for seven years.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POOR AND DESTITUTE<|>EVENT<|>The poor and destitute are individuals suffering during the festive season, prompting discussions about charity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTMAS<|>EVENT<|>Christmas is a festive season that Scrooge's nephew cherishes and tries to celebrate with his uncle.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>SCROOGE'S NEPHEW<|>Scrooge's nephew is trying to persuade Scrooge to embrace the spirit of Christmas, which Scrooge resists<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>CLERK<|>The clerk works for Scrooge and represents a contrasting attitude towards Christmas, being more cheerful<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>MARLEY<|>Scrooge is the surviving partner of Marley, who has been dead for seven years<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE'S NEPHEW<|>CHRISTMAS<|>Scrooge's nephew values Christmas and wishes to celebrate it, contrasting with Scrooge's views<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>POOR AND DESTITUTE<|>Scrooge shows indifference towards the plight of the poor and destitute during Christmas<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
