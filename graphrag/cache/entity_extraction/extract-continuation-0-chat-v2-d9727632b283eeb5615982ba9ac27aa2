The table shows that the provision for income taxes increased from $2,852 million in the three months ended July 1, 2023, to $4,046 million in the three months ended June 29, 2024. Similarly, the provision increased from $12,699 million to $14,875 million for the nine-month periods. The effective tax rate also increased from 12.5% to 15.9% for the three-month period and from 14.6% to 15.8% for the nine-month period. The statutory federal income tax rate remained consistent at 21% for all periods. \n\n<table><thead><tr><th></th><th colspan=\"2\">Three Months Ended</th><th colspan=\"2\">Nine Months Ended</th></tr><tr><th></th><th>June 29, 2024</th><th>July 1, 2023</th><th>June 29, 2024</th><th>July 1, 2023</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Provision for income taxes</td><td>$ 4,046</td><td>$ 2,852</td><td>$ 14,875</td><td>$ 12,699</td></tr><tr><td>Effective tax rate</td><td>15.9%</td><td>12.5%</td><td>15.8%</td><td>14.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Statutory federal income tax rate</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td><td>21%</td></tr></tbody></table>\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was higher compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by lower state income taxes.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2023 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $38.4 billion, with $38.3 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nCapital Return Program\n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has authorized share repurchase programs. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 29, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $26.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\n\nSegment Reporting\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported.
