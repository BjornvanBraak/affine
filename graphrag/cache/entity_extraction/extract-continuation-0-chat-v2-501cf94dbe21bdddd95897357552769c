Legal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the European Commission (the “Commission”) announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. If the Commission concludes that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and will continue to engage with the Commission as it conducts its investigations.\n\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and 16 state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nEpic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS® App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On March 13, 2024, Epic filed a motion with the California District Court disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction. The Company has filed an opposition to Epic’s motion. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\n\nIn January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari® in the EU to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. In addition, other jurisdictions may seek\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Company is involved in the technology industry and is subject to various legal proceedings and regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning its App Store operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Commission is the executive branch of the European Union responsible for proposing legislation and enforcing laws, including investigations under the Digital Markets Act.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Department of Justice is a federal executive department responsible for enforcing the law and defending the interests of the United States, including filing antitrust lawsuits.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPIC GAMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Epic Games, Inc. is a video game and software developer known for its legal actions against the Company regarding App Store practices.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGITAL MARKETS ACT<|>EVENT<|>The Digital Markets Act is a regulatory framework established by the EU to ensure fair competition in digital markets, under which the Company is being investigated.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COURT<|>GEO<|>The California District Court is a federal court where Epic Games filed a lawsuit against the Company regarding antitrust violations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEW JERSEY<|>GEO<|>The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey is where the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Company.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EUROPEAN COMMISSION<|>COMPANY<|>The European Commission has opened investigations against the Company under the Digital Markets Act for potential noncompliance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>COMPANY<|>The Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Company alleging monopolization in the smartphone market<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPIC GAMES<|>COMPANY<|>Epic Games filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging violations of antitrust laws related to its App Store<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COURT<|>EPIC GAMES<|>The California District Court is where Epic Games filed its lawsuit against the Company<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEW JERSEY<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>The Department of Justice filed its antitrust lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIGITAL MARKETS ACT<|>COMPANY<|>The Company is being investigated under the Digital Markets Act by the European Commission<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
