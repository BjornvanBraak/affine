There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first nine months of 2024. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of June 29, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”). The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\n\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nEpic Games\n\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\n\nOther Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>COMPANY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Company is involved in the preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements and is subject to various legal proceedings, including investigations under the Digital Markets Act and antitrust lawsuits.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The European Union is the political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe, which has opened investigations against the Company under the Digital Markets Act.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMISSION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Commission refers to the European Commission, which is responsible for proposing legislation and enforcing EU laws, including the Digital Markets Act.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The U.S. Department of Justice is the federal executive department responsible for the enforcement of the law and administration of justice in the United States, which has filed a lawsuit against the Company.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPIC GAMES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Epic Games, Inc. is a video game and software developer that has filed a lawsuit against the Company regarding antitrust violations related to the App Store.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COURT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The California District Court is a federal court where Epic Games filed a lawsuit against the Company regarding its App Store operations.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMARTPHONES<|>EVENT<|>The event refers to the market for performance smartphones and smartphones, which is the subject of the antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against the Company.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPANY<|>EU<|>The Company is under investigation by the EU for potential violations of the Digital Markets Act<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPANY<|>COMMISSION<|>The Commission has opened investigations against the Company under the Digital Markets Act<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPANY<|>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<|>The Department of Justice has filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Company<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPANY<|>EPIC GAMES<|>Epic Games has filed a lawsuit against the Company regarding antitrust violations related to the App Store<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPIC GAMES<|>CALIFORNIA DISTRICT COURT<|>Epic Games filed a lawsuit in the California District Court against the Company<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMPANY<|>SMARTPHONES<|>The Company is involved in the market for smartphones, which is the subject of the DOJ's antitrust lawsuit<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
