However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\n\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 29, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is 18 years.\n\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\n\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nThis table displays the notional amounts of the Company's outstanding derivative instruments as of June 29, 2024 and September 30, 2023, categorized by their designation as accounting hedges and their type (foreign exchange or interest rate contracts).  The table shows that the company had a total of $178,553 million in derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges in June 2024, compared to $194,105 million in September 2023. The company also had $97,136 million in foreign exchange contracts not designated as accounting hedges in June 2024, compared to $104,777 million in September 2023.

The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\n\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 46% and 18%.
